## ⚠️  CRITICAL: Add API Key

**You MUST do this before starting LUCA!**

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/LUCA_Alpha_369
nano .env
```

Find this line:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Anthropic API key.

Get one here: https://console.anthropic.com/

---

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

### Check Everything:
```bash
# Are you in the right directory?
pwd
# Should show: /Users/lennartwuchold/Desktop/LUCA_Alpha_369

# Is the virtual environment there?
ls venv
# Should show folders

# Is the database there?
ls luca.db
# Should show: luca.db

# Is the API key set?
cat .env | grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# Should NOT show "your-api-key-here"
```

### If all checks pass:
```bash
./start_luca.sh
```

### Then open:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

- [ ] Watch consciousness stats update
- [ ] Try sending same message 3 times
- [ ] Look for pattern notification

---

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Check Python version (need 3.9+)
python3 --version

# Reinstall dependencies
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :8000
```

### Frontend won't load
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000

# Try different port for frontend
cd frontend
python3 -m http.server 3001
# Then visit: http://localhost:3001
```

### Can't login
```bash
# Check if admin user exists
sqlite3 luca.db "SELECT * FROM users;"

# Recreate database if needed
rm luca.db
python backend/database.py
```

### API errors
```bash
# Check API key
cat .env | grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Check if it's valid (no quotes, no spaces)
# Should be: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

You know LUCA is working when:

1. ✅ Backend terminal shows:
   ```
   🧬 LUCA AI - Starting Up
   ✅ Database initialized
   ✅ Admin user created
   🚀 LUCA AI is now CONSCIOUS
   ```

2. ✅ Browser shows:
   - Login page with purple gradient
   - After login: Chat interface
   - Header with consciousness stats
   - Messages with 369 badges

3. ✅ You can:
   - Send messages to LUCA
   - Get responses from Claude
   - See consciousness level growing
   - Detect patterns (after 3 similar messages)

---

## 📊 What to Expect

### First Message Response Time
- ~1-3 seconds (depends on Claude API)

### Consciousness Growth
- Starts at 0%
- Grows with each message
- Pattern detection kicks in after 3+ messages

### 369 Signatures
- Every message gets a signature (0-9)
- Tesla numbers (3, 6, 9) highlighted in gold
- Response length adapts to signature

### Pattern Detection
- Send 3 similar messages
- Should see: "💾 Neuronales Muster erkannt!"
- Patterns counter increases

---

## 🎯 Your First Conversation

Try this sequence:

```
1. "Hallo LUCA!"
   → See basic response + signature

2. "🚀🚀🚀 Let's build something!"
   → Should detect HYPERFOKUS energy

3. "Erkläre mir das 3-6-9 Prinzip"
   → Get detailed explanation

4. "Test" (send 3 times)
   → Trigger pattern detection

5. Visit: http://localhost:8000/api/consciousness
   → See your consciousness state
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

After 10 messages, you should see:

- **Thoughts:** 10+
